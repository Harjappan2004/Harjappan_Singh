        <p>As a student, we often find it hard to manage sleep which directly impacts our lifestyle. Not just students
            but adults also suffer from same.</p>
        <p>Sleep is the rest stage of our body we can relate this to putting our device to shut down mode alongwith
            charging it. This means we should pay attention to this stage. Then the question arises "how much of it?".
            Well it depends person to person but we will go with average i.e 7hrs. No more no less. Bcoz less sleep leds
            to sleep deprivation and on the other hand, more sleep will cause heart problems which we don't want to
            have.</p>
        <p>So here are some tips which helped me to manage my sleep and this can do wonders to your life.
            Lets start with do's:
        <ol>
            <li>Do any kind of physical activity daily, be it exercise, gymming, running whatever you love, just do it.
            </li>
            <li>Create a mental image of bed as a place to sleep only, never ever try to work there.</li>
            <li>Maintain a proper schedule of sleeping and getting up, and follow it everyday, even on weekends also.
            </li>
            <li>Dim the lights of the room or complete dark</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p>Now lets see what we should not do:
        <ol>
            <li>No device before 1-2 hr of sleep be it phone, computer or anything having blue light</li>
            <li>Avoid eating a meal before 1-2 hr of sleep</li>
            <li>Limit the usage of caffeine</li>
            <li>Take naps but no more than 20 mins during the daytime</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p>And if you're tossing and turning, get up from bed and do something relaxing until you fall asleep.
        </p>

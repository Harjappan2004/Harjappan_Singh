        <p>I want to do a lot of things in my life. But the one thing that keeps me motivated all the time is to give my
            parents a beatutiful life
            as they put a lot of inputs on me and my education. So my short term goal is to land a software internship
            in my first sem or first year
            itself. Even if I get web dev, I would be more than happy to do it. I want to improve my technical skills in
            these two months I have, July
            and August. Like for real. I want to work hard on myself. So lets keep the things short
